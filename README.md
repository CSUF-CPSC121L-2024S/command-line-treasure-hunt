# Treasure Hunt

Use the command line to find the hidden treasure. You can use:

``cd`` to change directories

``ls`` to list files in a directory

``pwd`` to find out where you currently are

``cat`` to print a file to the terminal

Ready to get started? Start by typing `ls` in the terminal to list files:

```
$ ls
garden house README.md
```

The words ``garden`` ``house`` are bold or a different color because they are directories. ``README.md`` is a text file. Type ``cat README.md`` in the terminal to see this file!

Now let's go exploring. Go into the garden directory: ``cd garden``. Once you get there, ``ls`` to see what's around, and ``cat README.md`` to see your next set of instructions.

```
cd garden
ls
cat README.md
```

Good luck!
